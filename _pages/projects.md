Projects
======
* Large Language Model for Listwise Generative Recommendation (Ongoing Project) (2023)<br> 
    Introduced tuning technique in generative list-wise recommendation by combining lambda loss with NLG loss.
* [Financial Portfolio Management: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zIjaMn6OTybBAxK83nBX4d_EMgK5qirP/view?usp=sharing) 2023<br>
    Utilized Multi-Agent RL to model the collaboration an competition among stock groups to maximize Sharpe Ratio.
* [DisMult Variation Auto Encoder for uncertain knowledge graph](https://github.com/vincent40416/DistMult_VAE) (2022)<br>
    Supervised by Prof. [MiYen Yeh](https://homepage.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/miyen/index_en.html) in Academia Sinica.<br>
    Proposed uncertain knowledge graph embedding model and addressed the limitation of current evaluation metrics.
* [Daily News Analysis for Stock Prediction](https://github.com/vincent40416/Stock_Price_Prediction) (2021)<br>
    Combined world news data and stock transaction feature to predict DJIA; Achieved 58% accuracy in back testing.
* [Graph Neural Network for Graph Isomorphism](https://github.com/vincent40416/Graph_Isomorphism_w_Hypernode) (2020)
    Adviced by Prof. [QiFeng Chen](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=qifeng-chen-cqf) in HKUST.<br>
    Introduced hypernode with greedy algorithm for Graph Isomorphism Problem. (Failed in circulant skip link graph)
* [Video-based Person Re-identification](https://github.com/vincent40416/RE_ID) (2019)<br>
    Decomposed spatial and temporal features in video with mAP 77.5%, outperforming baselines in MARS.
* [Face Super-Resolution with Parsing](https://github.com/vincent40416/SRGAN) (2018)
    Supervised by Prof. [ShuengHan CHAN](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=gary-shueng-han-chan-gchan) in HKUST. <br>
    Incorporate image parsing pre-trained model to increase peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) from 27 to 28 in CelebA.
