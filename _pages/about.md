I am an MPhil student at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/) (HKUST) supervised by Prof. [Hao Liu](https://raymondhliu.github.io/). Recently, I received B.S. in Computer Science Computer Science and in Applied Mathematics (double major and First-Class Honors, the highest honor) from HKUST.

My interest in Machine Learning began when I did a project regarding face-superresolution with statistical learning, supervised by Prof. [Gary Shueng Han CHAN](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=gary-shueng-han-chan-gchan) from HKUST. 
I've also researched on exploring the possibility of solving Graph Isomorphism Problem by introducing GNN with statistical approach advised by Prof. [Qifeng Chen](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=qifeng-chen-cqf).
Afterwards, I joined Academia Sinica as research assistant under [Mi Yen Yehâ€™s](https://homepage.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/miyen/index_en.html) supervision, working on the representation learning in uncertain knowledge graph. 
Recently, I worked in Boss Zhiping CSL Lab aiming at exploring the reasoning capability of Large Language Model in recommendation system.
