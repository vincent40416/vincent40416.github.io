Welcome
======
I am an MPhil student at [the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/) (HKUST) supervised by Prof. [Hao Liu](https://raymondhliu.github.io/). I received B.S. with a double major in computer science and applied mathematics (First-Class Honor) from HKUST in 2021.

Recently, I work in [Boss Zhipin](https://ir.zhipin.com/) Career Science Lab (Beijing) as research intern aiming at exploring the capability of Large Language Model in recommender system. 

For my personal hobbies, please check [Misc.](/miscellaneous).

Research Interests
======
I am interested in the Data Mining and Natural Language Processing with the work spanning
* Large Language Model
* Hallucination
* Graph Neural Network
<!-- * Multivariate Time Series Forecasting -->
* Data Mining in Real-World Application

For the detail of my project experience, please check [1-page resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lPM4-1jmYeEr1scexEjgNr2m6uhtUrrr/view?usp=sharing).
