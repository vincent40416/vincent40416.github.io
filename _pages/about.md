I am an MPhil student at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/) (HKUST) supervised by Prof. [Hao Liu](https://raymondhliu.github.io/). Recently, I received B.S. in Computer Science Computer Science and in Applied Mathematics (double major and First-Class Honors, the highest honor) from HKUST.

My interest in Machine Learning began when I did a project regarding face-superresolution with statistical learning, supervised by Prof. [ShuengHan CHAN](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=gary-shueng-han-chan-gchan) from HKUST. 

I've also researched on exploring the possibility of solving Graph Isomorphism Problem by introducing GNN with statistical approach advised by Prof. [QiFeng Chen](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=qifeng-chen-cqf).

Afterwards, I joined Academia Sinica as research assistant under [MiYen Yehâ€™s](https://homepage.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/miyen/index_en.html) supervision, working on the representation learning in uncertain knowledge graph. 
During my first-year Mphil study, I've research on the Skill Demand-Supply Joint Prediction Problem supervised by Prof. [Hao Liu](https://raymondhliu.github.io/).
Recently, I worked in Boss Zhiping Career Science Lab aiming at exploring the reasoning capability of Large Language Model in recommendation system.
